**Date**: April 29, 2025  
**Author**: GitHub Copilot (assisting Daniel E. Williams)  
**Project**: Launch of `dewilliams.co` to align with the strategic vision of scaling D. E. Williams and Company to $1M in revenue by 2027, as specified in the PRD, bio, implementation plan, and feature requirements (`prd.md`, `bio.md`, `implementation-plan.md`, `frd.md`).

## 1. Overview

This Architecture Specifications Document defines the technical architecture for the `dewilliams.co` website, a lead-generating platform for D. E. Williams and Company, a boutique strategic advisory firm specializing in education and workforce innovation. The website will showcase services, case studies, Daniel E. Williams' professional experience, and client logos, driving client inquiries and reinforcing thought leadership via Substack essays (https://thetechexec.substack.com). The architecture is designed to meet the launch features outlined in the Feature Requirements Document (FRD), ensuring a minimalist design with full responsiveness. Built with Next.js and hosted on AWS, the architecture prioritizes scalability, performance, security, and maintainability to support 1,000 monthly visitors at launch (Q3 2025) and scale to 10,000 by 2027.

The architecture supports:
- **Launch Features**: Responsive navigation, homepage with hero/services/logos/case studies/SubStack blog, services page, case studies page with gated PDFs, about page with bio, contact page with form, SEO optimization, and analytics/heatmap tracking.
- **Strategic Goals**: Generate 10 qualified leads/month, achieve 1,000 unique visitors/month, and drive 30% of 2025 revenue ($120k of $400k) from website inquiries.
- **Non-Functional Requirements**: Page load time <2 seconds, WCAG 2.1 compliance, HTTPS security, and modular code for maintainability.

## 2. System Architecture

### 2.1 High-Level Architecture
The website follows a serverless, static-first architecture leveraging Next.js’s App Router for hybrid rendering (static and server-side). AWS handles hosting, CI/CD, and domain management, with external integrations for lead capture (HubSpot), analytics (Google Analytics), and user behavior tracking (Hotjar). Content is primarily static, with Substack essays hardcoded initially and potential dynamic RSS integration in Q4 2025. The architecture is modular, with reusable components and a clear separation of concerns.

**Components**:
- **Frontend**: Next.js (React) with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and Shadcn/UI components.
- **Backend**: AWS serverless functions for form submissions (HubSpot integration).
- **Storage**: Static assets (images, PDFs) in AWS’ file system (`public/`).
- **Integrations**: HubSpot (CRM), Google Analytics (tracking), Hotjar (heatmaps).
- **Content**: Hardcoded JSON for essays/case studies, Markdown for bio, static images for logos.
