# Daniel E. Williams | Strategic Technology Executive | Founder, D. E. Williams & Co.

With over two decades of experience, I am a strategic technology leader who solves complex challenges for edtech, public sector, nonprofit, and private sector organizations. A close colleague describes me as having “the mind of an engineer and the soul of an artist,” a blend of analytical precision and creative insight that drives my ability to forge trusted relationships with VP, C-level, and board-level executives. My passion for innovation, fueled by interests in startups, tech investing, and vibrant commentary on movies and TV shows, delivers transformative outcomes across industries.

Rooted in computer science and management consulting, I began my career coding Java, C#, Perl, PHP, and Python. Early on, I developed a cloud-based collaboration app for music producers and a voice-activated text search app for recruiters, which I sold to my employer, showcasing entrepreneurial acumen. I also led the Federal Reserve’s Data Download, the first platform to enable statistical data sharing among the FRB, World Bank, IMF, and BLS, revolutionizing global data access.

At SAIC, I deepened my technical expertise, paving the way for strategic advisory roles. At Booz Allen Hamilton, I spearheaded strategic tech investments, earning a reputation as a “technology agnostic” problem solver. I led the development of the award-winning “Hello” employee networking app, enhancing enterprise collaboration, and authored white papers like “Meeting the Challenges of a Modern CIO” and “People, Process, Technology Strategy for Enterprise Collaboration.” These insights were adopted by Law Enforcement, Intelligence, Defense, Homeland Security, and Energy sectors, driving operational efficiency.

With graduate school friends from George Mason University, I co-founded Zengredients, a recipe-based grocery recommendation service, merging technology with consumer needs. Consulting for Toyota, I transformed the Dealer Information System, an API delivering legal and marketing data for nearly 1,400 North American dealers, with a strategy generating over $10M annually in new revenue. I also led the first AWS-based disaster recovery for the system, achieving 99.999% uptime, and managed a $35M digital project portfolio for the Lexus brand, launching innovative retail tools for the Lexus Future Retail Initiative.

Inspired by a chance meeting on a flight from LA to DC, I co-founded Likely, the first betting and analytics market for social media influencer popularity, enabling brands to identify rising influencers early. As a Senior Principal at Pariveda Solutions, I drove digital transformation for clients. I advised Mindsight, a developer analytics startup acquired by Facebook, and Ariglad, a startup enhancing enterprise service automation through data analytics for knowledge bases and support tickets.

In 2024, I founded D. E. Williams & Co., a strategic technology advisory firm specializing in digital transformation, cloud solutions, and AI-driven innovation. My firm delivers measurable value to clients using tools like NotebookLM and GenAI Agents, optimizing operations, predicting donor churn, and enhancing decision-making for edtech, nonprofit, and public sector organizations. Previously, I served as a technology incubation advisor at JFFLabs, guiding strategic initiatives. I am an At-Large Director on the George Mason Alumni Board and have advised the boards of Bowie State University and Ariglad. 

When I am not working and advising clients, I enjoy reading, writing, working out, and time with my wife and two sons on the beaches of coastal Virginia.
