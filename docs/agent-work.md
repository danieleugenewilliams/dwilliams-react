# Agent Work

## Prompt
You are an expert fullstack architect and software engineer assisting me with the implementation of this app.

Use this file to keep track of current tasks and notes.

## Project Documentation

Review documentation files to get a thorough understanding of the goals and current status of the project.
- documentation/implementation-plan.md

Use pnpm instead of npm

Use pnpm dev-https instead of pnpm dev

Use Jest for automated tests

Before implementing any feature, write the automated test that will be run to test and validate the feature implementation.

If anything is unclear or needs clarification, DO ask me questions.

## Implementation Plan with tasks broken down into phases

- documentation/implementation-plan.md

## In Progress

### AWS Amplify Pre-Launch Setup (May 23, 2025)
- [x] Begin AWS Amplify configuration
  - [x] Install AWS CLI and AWS Amplify CLI
  - [x] Create `amplify.yml` for build configuration
  - [x] Create `amplify-config.json` with project settings
  - [x] Document required environment variables
  - [x] Create AWS Amplify deployment guide
  - [x] Set up development environment in AWS
  - [x] Create new application in AWS Amplify Console
  - [ ] Configure build settings and environment variables
  - [ ] Connect GitHub repository to Amplify
  - [ ] Configure SSL certificates
  - [ ] Connect repository to Amplify
  - [ ] Configure build settings
  - [ ] Set up environment variables
  - [ ] Test deployment pipeline
  - [ ] Document deployment procedures

## Completed Tasks

- [x] Fixed "self is not defined" error with simplified server-polyfills.js solution (May 22, 2025)
  - Resolved 400 errors appearing on every page while maintaining the fix for the original error
  - Verified solution works in both development and production environments
  - Updated documentation in lessons-learned.md
- [x] __tests__/api/user-data.test.ts
- [x] __tests__/api/newsletter-subscribe.test.ts
- [x] __tests__/api/download-case-study.test.ts (Removed: See lessons-learned.md. Endpoint now covered by Playwright integration test.)
- [x] __tests__/security/sensitive-data-exposure.test.ts (Removed: See lessons-learned.md. Endpoint now covered by Playwright integration test.)
- [x] The custom form submission didn't include an IP address. This could affect your form analytics.
  - Note: IP address capture is implemented in `app/api/contact/route.ts` by reading `x-forwarded-for` or `x-real-ip` headers. If these headers are not present or are empty in the request (common in local dev without a reverse proxy, or if the hosting environment doesn't set them), no IP is sent to HubSpot. This is expected behavior. The `::1` IP is the IPv6 loopback and would appear if a header contained it.
- [x] The cookie needed to link form submissions to existing contacts isn't being sent. You'll need to ask your developer to update the integration for this form.
  - Note: The `hutk` cookie is now read on the client-side in `components/marketing/contact-form.tsx` and passed to the `/api/contact` endpoint. The API route then includes it in the `context.hutk` field of the HubSpot submission payload.
- [x] Error when submitting email to request data - Fixed

## Security Testing Status

## Security Implementation Notes

### Cookie Security Implementation (May 14, 2025)
1. Cookie security testing completed:
   - Created middleware.ts to intercept and secure all cookies
   - Implemented cookie-security.ts utility library
   - Updated HubSpot integration to restrict cookie access
   - Added security attributes (Secure, SameSite) to all cookies
   - Fixed overly broad domain attributes
   - Implemented proper sanitization for all input fields
   - All cookie security tests now passing
   
2. Newsletter API sanitization:
   - Created dedicated test for newsletter API input sanitization
   - Implemented DOMPurify to sanitize all user input
   - Proved HTML & XSS prevention works correctly
   - Ensured proper validation of email formats

Previous focus on fixing the newsletter subscription HubSpot integration test has been completed. The mock implementation is now working correctly and all test scenarios are passing.

## Track Future or Postponed Tasks

- [x] Fix theme switching animation
  - Investigate the cause of the missing animation when switching themes
  - Implement a smooth transition for theme switching
- [x] Fix React Testing Library act() deprecation warning
  - Verify all act imports are from react package
  - Update @testing-library/react and react/react-dom if needed
- [x] FAIL  __tests__/components/layout/theme-switching.test.tsx
  - Theme Switching in Layout Components › Header appearance with different themes › handles theme switching from dropdown menu.
  - TestingLibraryElementError: Unable to find an element by: [data-testid="theme-option-light"]
- [x] Implement print-optimized versions of pages/documents *postpone until atfter launch*
- [x] Increase rate limiter test coverage to 100%
  - Added direct unit test for `logRateLimitInfo` to ensure 100% function coverage.
  - Patched test setup to avoid issues with `process.env.NODE_ENV` and custom mocks.
  - All error paths, edge cases, and logging are now fully tested.
  - All tests pass and `lib/rate-limit.ts` is at 100% coverage.
  - See `__tests__/lib/rate-limit.test.ts` for details.
- [ ] Design and implement automated data retention/deletion system
  - (Superseded by manual process below; see next section.)
- [ ] Implement manual document retention and deletion process (monthly)
  - At the end of each month, perform the following steps:
    - Case study download emails:
      - Review and delete any emails older than the retention period from the storage location (DB, file, or service).
    - HubSpot:
      - Use HubSpot admin or API to review and delete user data as required.
    - Redis:
      - Review and delete expired or unnecessary user/session data.
  - Substack (Newsletter/Insights):
    - Retention and deletion are managed by Substack's own policies.
    - Direct users to Substack's privacy/data policy for newsletter data deletion requests.
  - Document each monthly review and deletion for audit/compliance purposes.
  - Update privacy policy to reflect the manual retention/deletion process and Substack's role.
  - Checklist for monthly review:
    - [ ] Review case study download email storage
    - [ ] Review HubSpot data
    - [ ] Review Redis data
    - [ ] Document actions taken
    - [ ] Update privacy policy if needed
- [x] Fix resource preload warning for hero.avif image
  - Review preload link tag implementation
  - Add appropriate 'as' attribute
  - Verify intentional preload timing
- [x] Fix image warnings
  - All usages of Next.js `Image` and custom `OptimizedImage` with the `fill` prop have been reviewed.
  - Confirmed all parents have valid positioning (`relative`, `absolute`, etc.) as required by Next.js.
  - Image warnings are false positives and not caused by incorrect code.
  - Findings and investigation are documented in `agent-work.md` and related documentation files.
- [x] Resolve Next.js hydration mismatch error
  - Investigated hydration mismatch warning in browser console.
  - Determined the mismatch is caused by browser extensions (e.g., Grammarly) injecting attributes into the DOM before React hydrates.
  - This is not a bug in the codebase; it is a false positive that only appears for users with certain extensions installed.
  - No code changes are required. Documented the cause and resolution in `agent-work.md`.
- [x] Implement /terms page

---

## In Progress: Fix theme switching animation

- Investigate the cause of the missing animation when switching themes.
- Review the implementation in `components/theme-provider.tsx` and any related CSS (e.g., `globals.css`).
- Plan to implement a smooth transition for background and text color changes when toggling dark/light mode.
