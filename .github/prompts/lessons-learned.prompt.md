Review the project documentation and codebase to create a comprehensive lessons learned analysis. The findings should be documented in `documentation/lessons-learned.md` using the following structure:

# Lessons Learned from Project Implementation

## Best Practices
- Document demonstrated patterns that improved code quality, maintainability, and team efficiency
- Highlight successful architectural decisions and their positive impacts
- Identify effective processes and workflows that enhanced productivity
- List tools and technologies that proved particularly valuable

## Pitfalls to Avoid
- Detail technical challenges encountered and their resolutions
- Document anti-patterns discovered during development
- Describe resource constraints and mitigation strategies
- List assumptions that proved incorrect or problematic

## Key Takeaways
- Summarize critical success factors
- Document innovations or novel solutions developed
- Highlight areas where the team excelled
- Note opportunities for future optimization

## Recommendations
- Propose specific, actionable improvements for future projects
- Suggest process refinements based on experience
- Recommend tools or practices worth adopting
- Identify areas requiring additional focus or resources

Please analyze commit history, pull requests, issue tracking, and team communications to ensure comprehensive coverage. Include concrete examples where possible, and quantify impacts when data is available. Focus on insights that are transferable to future projects.
