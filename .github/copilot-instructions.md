# GitHub Copilot Instructions for dewilliamsco-react

## Workspace Overview
This project is a Vite + React (TypeScript) app, set up for migration from a Next.js codebase. It uses Tailwind CSS for styling and React Router for client-side routing.

## Key Conventions
- Use React functional components and hooks.
- Use React Router for all routing (no Next.js routing).
- Use Tailwind CSS utility classes for styling.
- All new code should be TypeScript.
- Place assets in `src/assets/` and components in `src/components/`.
- Use `npm` for all dependency management and scripts.

## Migration Notes
- Pages and logic from the old Next.js app should be migrated as React components and routes.
- No SSR or API routes: this is a static SPA.
- Update README.md with any new migration steps or conventions.

## Useful Scripts
- `npm run dev` — Start local dev server
- `npm run build` — Build for production
- `npm run preview` — Preview production build
