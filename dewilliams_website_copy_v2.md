# D. E. Williams + Co. — Website Copy v2.0
## With Strategic Rationale

---

# STRATEGIC CONTEXT

## The Situation (January 2026)
- LocalMemory generated 1 sale in 3 weeks; the AI memory market has contracted as Claude, GPT, and Gemini now have native memory and longer context windows
- Multiple ventures in exploration (health tracker, ReckonGrid, restaurant, farm) but none validated
- No current income stream; dividends only
- Strong LinkedIn network: former consulting colleagues, clients, classmates, GMU alumni board

## The Decision
Shut down active LocalMemory development (maintenance mode), pivot to AI advisory consulting as fastest path to revenue. One asset can generate income in 30 days: **you**.

## The Positioning Insight
Most AI consultants either advise (strategy decks, never touch code) or build (code, no business context). Daniel does both. This is rare and valuable.

The resume proves it:
- TaxAct: converted 20-year-old C++ to modern stack, saved $2.5M year one
- Daylight Transport: process mapping → 3-year cloud strategy → $250K funding secured  
- NFL Digital Media: org design + product engineering → $5M annual savings
- Transportation client: $28K → $4M revenue in 9 months

These aren't "advised on AI." These are "shipped AI that made money."

## Future Opportunity
Training/online courses as leverage play—time for money once, then it sells passively. But this requires knowing what people actually need, which comes from consulting engagements first. Sequence: consulting → learn market needs → build training.

## HERO SECTION

**Headline:**
# From AI Experiments to AI Results

**Subhead:**
I help companies stop piloting and start shipping. Strategy, architecture, and implementation—I build AI solutions that work, then train your team to own them.

**CTA Button:**
Let's Talk →

### Rationale
- "Experiments to Results" names the exact pain point: companies stuck in pilot purgatory
- Subhead immediately differentiates: not just strategy (advise) or just code (build), but the full loop including team enablement
- "Train your team to own them" addresses the fear of consultant dependency—you're not creating lock-in
- CTA is action-oriented, low commitment language

---

## THE PROBLEM

Most companies are stuck in AI purgatory.

They've run pilots. They've seen demos. They have a Slack channel full of ChatGPT screenshots. But nothing's in production. Nothing's making money. The gap between "this is cool" and "this runs our business" feels impossibly wide.

That gap is where I work.

### Rationale
- Opens with pain, not credentials—the reader should feel seen before they learn about you
- "AI purgatory" is visceral and specific; anyone who's lived this knows exactly what it means
- "Slack channel full of ChatGPT screenshots" is a concrete detail that builds credibility—you've seen this movie before
- "That gap is where I work" is a one-line positioning statement that lands hard

---

## WHAT I DO

**I don't advise from the sidelines.** I architect, build, and deploy.

- **Process Mapping → AI Architecture**: I find where AI actually creates value in your operations—not where it sounds impressive
- **Implementation**: I build production systems, not prototypes
- **Team Enablement**: I train your people to maintain and extend what we build, so you're not dependent on me forever

This isn't a 6-month discovery phase. It's focused execution with measurable outcomes.

### Rationale
- "I don't advise from the sidelines" directly attacks the competition: McKinsey-style consultants who deliver decks and leave
- Three-part structure (map → build → enable) is a clear service offering without being a menu
- "Not where it sounds impressive" signals pragmatism and business focus over tech hype
- "So you're not dependent on me forever" preempts the objection and builds trust
- "6-month discovery phase" is a dig at enterprise consulting bloat—signals you move fast

## PROOF

**$2.5M saved in year one**
Led TaxAct's legacy modernization—automatically converting 20-year-old C++ to modern C# and React, then scaling the solution across their codebase.

**$28K → $4M in 9 months**
Accelerated a transportation client's business transformation through integrated product strategy, technical architecture, and executive alignment.

**$5M annual operational savings**
Reimagined NFL Digital Media's organizational design and product engineering strategy.

**$250K partner funding secured**
Guided Daylight Transport's 3-year cloud infrastructure strategy through comprehensive process mapping and stakeholder collaboration.

**Zero loss of life**
Led customer strategy for Stop Soldier Suicide's platform rearchitecture, enabling AI-driven signals of suicidality for clinicians serving veterans.

### Rationale
- Outcomes, not activities. Dollar signs and results, not "led a team of 11" or "managed stakeholders"
- Each proof point is: metric + one sentence of context. Scannable.
- Mix of financial ($2.5M, $5M) and human (zero loss of life) impact shows range and values
- "Zero loss of life" is the most powerful line—it's unexpected on a consulting site and demonstrates work with meaning
- Name-brand clients (NFL, TaxAct) build credibility; transportation client unnamed is fine—the number speaks

## BACKGROUND

20+ years leading technology initiatives at Booz Allen Hamilton, Pariveda Solutions, and enterprise clients including Toyota, Lexus, NFL, and Federal Reserve Board.

I've won $9M+ in new business, built and led consulting practices generating $6M+ annually, and shipped solutions across financial services, transportation, healthcare, nonprofit, and media.

MS in Technology Management, George Mason University  
BS in Computer Science, Bowie State University  
Lean Six Sigma Green Belt • PMP • Scrum Master

### Rationale
- Background section comes AFTER proof—you earn the right to talk about yourself by showing results first
- Company names (Booz Allen, Pariveda, Toyota, NFL, Federal Reserve) do credibility work without explanation
- "$9M+ in new business" proves you understand commercial reality, not just delivery
- Credentials listed but not emphasized—they're table stakes, not differentiators
- GMU connection is relevant given alumni board position—could open doors

## HOW IT WORKS

1. **Discovery Call** (30 min, free): You tell me what's stuck. I tell you if I can help.
2. **Scoping Session** (paid): We map the problem, define success metrics, and build a work plan.
3. **Execution**: I build. You ship. Your team learns.

### Rationale
- Three steps. Simple. No mystery about what happens next.
- Discovery call is free—low friction to start conversation
- Scoping session is PAID—this is important. It qualifies serious buyers and establishes that your time has value from the start
- "I tell you if I can help" signals selectivity—you're not desperate for any deal
- "You ship. Your team learns." reinforces the enablement promise from earlier

## WORK WITH ME

I take on 2-3 clients at a time. If you're serious about moving from AI experiments to AI results, let's talk.

**[Email]** DanielEugeneWilliams@gmail.com  
**[LinkedIn]** linkedin.com/in/danieleugenewilliams  
**[Call]** (202) 431-1262

### Rationale
- "2-3 clients at a time" creates scarcity and signals you're selective, not a body shop
- Repeats the headline language ("AI experiments to AI results") for coherence
- Multiple contact options—some people prefer email, some phone, some LinkedIn. Remove friction.
- Consider adding Calendly link to further reduce friction for booking discovery calls

---

## FUTURE SECTION: TRAINING (Placeholder)

*[To be added: Online training / workshops on AI implementation for teams and executives. Structure TBD based on consulting engagement learnings.]*

### Rationale
- Training is a leverage play: your time for money once, then passive income
- BUT you need to know what people actually struggle with before building training
- Consulting engagements will reveal: What questions do clients ask repeatedly? Where do teams get stuck? What do executives not understand?
- After 5-10 engagements, patterns will emerge. Build training for those patterns.
- Potential formats: 
  - Live cohort-based workshop (higher price, more engagement)
  - Self-paced course (scales infinitely, lower touch)
  - Executive briefings (half-day, premium pricing)
- Placeholder stays until you have data

# IMPLEMENTATION NOTES

## Tone
- Confident, direct, no fluff
- You're selective, not desperate
- Pragmatic over hype—business outcomes over tech buzzwords

## Design Principles
- Keep current minimal aesthetic—it signals confidence and sophistication
- Hero + Problem + What I Do should be visible without scrolling on desktop
- Proof section can be cards or a simple vertical list
- Single CTA repeated throughout: email or calendar link
- Mobile responsive is essential—executives browse on phones

## Recommended Adds
- **Calendly integration**: Embed or link for discovery call booking—removes email back-and-forth friction
- **1-2 testimonial quotes**: Reach out to JFF contacts, Pariveda colleagues, or past clients for short quotes. Even 1-2 sentences adds social proof.
- **Optional blog/writing section**: Your Substack content could live here or link out. Demonstrates thought leadership.

## Content to NOT Include
- Lengthy bio or "about me" narrative—the proof section does this work
- Service menus with hourly rates—keep pricing for direct conversations
- Technology lists or tool logos—you're selling outcomes, not tech stack
- Stock photos—minimal design or real photos only

---

# 7-DAY LAUNCH PLAN

## Day 1-2: Finalize & Build
- Review this copy, make any adjustments
- Update dewilliams.co with new copy
- Set up Calendly for discovery calls (optional but recommended)
- Confirm LocalMemory checkout working (done) and put in maintenance mode mentally

## Day 3-4: LinkedIn Outreach Blitz
- Post announcement (not salesy):
  > "I'm taking on a few advisory clients for Q1. If your company is figuring out how to actually implement AI—not just talk about it—I'd welcome a conversation."
- Direct message 20 warm contacts personally:
  > "Hey [name], I'm doing AI implementation consulting now. Do you know anyone struggling to move from AI pilots to production? Happy to chat if useful."

## Day 5-7: Network Activation
- Leverage GMU alumni board—any appropriate channel to mention availability?
- Follow up on any responses from LinkedIn
- Book discovery calls

## Success Metric
Billable engagement secured by end of week 4.
